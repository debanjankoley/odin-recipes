    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, we make a chilli paste. Take 8 soaked dry kashmiri chillies 
            and grind them with a dash of water and keep aside.</li>
        <li>To marinate the chicken we take 400gms of boneless chicken(cut them in small bite sized pieces)
            and add salt to taste, pepper powder a pinch, baking soda 1/2tsp, ginger-garlic paste, 
            2tbsp of maida, 2tbsp of cornstarch, 1 egg and mix it well. Keep it aside for 30min 
            or more.</li>
        <li>Then we'll fry it in medium hot oil. When it's light golden brown color we take it out.</li>
        <li>Now we have to make the sauce. Take some oil in a wok and add 2 whole dry red chillies(optional), 
            add some chopped ginger(2tsp) and garlic(1tbsp), add 1 chopped green chilli and fry it for some time.</li>
        <li>When the garlic starts to brown add diced onions(1.5 cup) and diced capsicum(1/2 cup). Toss it well.</li>
        <li>Add Soya-sauce(3tbsp), tomato-ketchup(3tbsp), vinegar(1tbsp), salt and chilli-paste(2tbsp) and the chicken. 
            Toss it well and add 1 cup of water.</li>
        <li>Take some water and cornstarch and mix it to make a slurry. Mix it with the chicken and let it boil a bit.</li>
        <li>Add some spring onions as garnish and your dish is ready.</li>
